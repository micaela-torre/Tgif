                        <p class="fw-light text-start">Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
                            transparency. In a
                            free
                            society, transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is
                            at
                            the
                            heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that
                            government should be transparent.

                            Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public
                            business
                            and
                            spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
                            allows
                            good
                            and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for
                            citizens
                            about what their Government is doing.

                            We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                            Government's
                            effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
                            society,
                            and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you
                            to
                            use
                            our site to become actively engaged in American government.

                            TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We
                            solicit
                            public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.

                            <p class="fw-light text-start">In the West, the idea that government should be open to
                                public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the
                                Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state
                                secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
                                instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which
                                then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation
                                as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Pres Act, 1766). This approach, and that of
                                the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the
                                eighteenth-century public sphere.
                                Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776)
                                and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for
                                budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the
                                attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously
                                opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton
                                prominent among the latter.
                                Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
                                democratic
                                practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation.
                                Scandinavian
                                countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the
                                origins
                                of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the
                                presumption of
                                openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
                                Documents
                                in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).
                                The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966,
                                FOIAs,
                                Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway
                                in
                                1970.
